# OOP with C++ – Files and Streams

## 📚 Files and Streams in C++

This repository contains C++ programs and practical implementations based on the **Files and Streams** unit of Object-Oriented Programming with C++.

The programs demonstrate file handling concepts such as opening, reading, writing, navigating files, using file pointers, and handling file-related errors.

## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to File Handling

File handling is used to **store and retrieve data from files** permanently.

C++ provides file handling through the **fstream** library.

---

### 2. Types of Files

The main types of files are:

* **Text Files**
* **Binary Files**

Text files store data in a human-readable format, while binary files store data in binary form.

---

### 3. Streams

A stream represents the flow of data between a program and an input/output source.

Common file stream classes:

* `ifstream` → Reading from a file
* `ofstream` → Writing to a file
* `fstream` → Reading and writing

---

### 4. Header Files

The main header file used for file handling is:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
```

Other commonly used headers include:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
```

---

## 📂 File Operations

### 5. Opening a File

A file can be opened using `open()`.

```cpp
ofstream file;

file.open("data.txt");
```

A file can also be opened while creating the stream object:

```cpp
ofstream file("data.txt");
```

---

### 6. Writing to a File

`ofstream` is used to write data into a file.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    ofstream file("data.txt");

    file << "Hello C++ File Handling";

    file.close();

    return 0;
}
```

---

### 7. Reading from a File

`ifstream` is used to read data from a file.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    ifstream file("data.txt");

    string text;

    while (getline(file, text))
    {
        cout << text << endl;
    }

    file.close();

    return 0;
}
```

---

### 8. Reading and Writing Using `fstream`

`fstream` can be used for both reading and writing.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    fstream file("data.txt", ios::in | ios::out | ios::app);

    file << "New Data" << endl;

    file.close();

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 📍 File Pointers and Navigation

C++ provides functions for navigating within files.

### `seekg()`

Moves the **get/read pointer**.

```cpp
file.seekg(0);
```

### `seekp()`

Moves the **put/write pointer**.

```cpp
file.seekp(0);
```

### `tellg()`

Returns the current position of the read pointer.

```cpp
cout << file.tellg();
```

### `tellp()`

Returns the current position of the write pointer.

```cpp
cout << file.tellp();
```

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

File operations can fail for several reasons, such as:

* File does not exist
* File cannot be opened
* Permission problems
* Reading beyond the available data

C++ provides functions to check file status:

```cpp
file.is_open()
file.eof()
file.fail()
file.good()
file.bad()
```

Example:

```cpp
if (!file.is_open())
{
    cout << "File could not be opened.";
}
```
